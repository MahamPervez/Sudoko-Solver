# Sudoko-Solver
This project implements a Sudoku Solver using backtracking algorithm in Python. The solver systematically fills the empty cells of a Sudoku grid with valid numbers, backtracking when it reaches a dead-end. The implementation ensures an optimal and complete solution to any Sudoku puzzle.
